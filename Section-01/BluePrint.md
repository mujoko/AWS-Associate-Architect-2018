So the exams are 130 minutes in length.
You're going to have about 60 questions sometimes this can change but hopefully it will never be more

than 60.

And they're all going to be multiple choice sometimes you have to choose one and so sometimes you have
to choose two.

It'll tell you in the question how many you have to choose and your results are always going to be between

100 to 1000 and your past smok is 720.

You need to get it roughly about 70 percent in order to pass the exam.

So always aim for 70 percent.

The qualification itself is valid for two years and the exam questions are all going to be scenario

based questions so bear that in mind as well.

They're never going to ask you know what is the name of simple storage service which is S3 which is

going to learn as we go forward.

They're going to give you much more advanced scenario questions and ask you about different use cases.
